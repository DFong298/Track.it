# Track.it
A full-stack web application that lets you keep track of a portfolio that you create. 

It is very close to paper trading, except the amount of stocks you are allowed to buy has no limits. You can test realistic portfolios, or pretend you are the CEO
of an investment firm and buy half of Apple's existing shares. The oppurtunities are endless

The app currently is not deployed yet, but it will be soon. Currently, in testing, the app looks like this:

The app will be fully deployed soon, as it is still currently in development.
